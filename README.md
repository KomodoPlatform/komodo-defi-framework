# AtomicDEX Marketmaker V2

This repository contains the `work in progress` code of brand new Marketmaker version built mainly on Rust.  
The current state can be considered as very early alpha.  
**Use with test coins only. You risk to lose your money in case of trying to trade assets with real market cost.**

## Project structure

[mm2src](mm2src) - Rust code, contains some parts ported from C `as is` (e.g. `lp_ordermatch`) to reach the most essential/error prone code. Some other modules/crates are reimplemented from scratch.

## How to build

1. Tools required: [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/). You will also need your OS specific build tools (e.g. build-essentials on Linux, XCode on OSX or MSVC on Win).
1. (Optional) OSX: install openssl, e.g. `brew install openssl`.  
1. (Optional) OSX: run `LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib`
1. Run
    ```
    rustup install nightly-2021-07-18
    rustup default nightly-2021-07-18
    rustup component add rustfmt-preview
    ```
1. Run `cargo build` (or `cargo build -vv` to get verbose build output).
